      <ul class="style3">
        <li class="first">
          <p>As a rising senior at Swarthmore College, I had the pleasure of interning at Nest, a home-automation/-innovation tech company started in 2009 - in true Silicon Valley fashion - in a founder's garage. Over the winter break of 2013/14, I happened upon a post from an alum on <a href="http://www.swarthmore.edu/career-services">Swarthmore's Experience portal</a> advertising internship opportunities at Nest, and proceeded to complete four interviews by January, three with members of the team I was joining and one with the team leader and manager, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoky_Matsuoka">Yoky Matsuoka</a>. Having the chance to interview with (and eventually work with!) a MacArthur Genius Award winner, one-time Head of Innovation at Google, and cofounder of Google[x] sold me on Nest and I accepted the subsequent internship offer without a second thought.</p>
          <p>Nest is a wonderful, exciting place to work: a company with small-startup intensity, mid-sized-company clout, and <a href="https://investor.google.com/releases/2014/0113.html">Google-sized</a> perks, it creates beautiful products with Apple-esque<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> attention to detail and plenty of fascinating science powering them. I interned on the Technology/Algorithms team (naming teams is difficult when the company doubles in the space of months) that is responsible for designing, prototyping, testing, and developing the algorithms that make the products "smart". Being the sole undergraduate on a 18-person team (the next-youngest person was 25; the other two interns were PhD students) meant two things: that I was learning about software engineering at a somewhat alarming rate, and that Swat had uniquely prepared me to contribute to a superbly talented, incredibly intelligent, and mindblowingly nice group of people.</p>
          <p>Apart from getting you to think about trying to work at Nest, I'm writing this to give you some context for the esoteric CS classes that you'll take during your time at Swat. <tt>These are the three things I took with me from Swat into the "real world".</tt></p>

          <h2 id="sec1">1. Programming: With Git, In Pairs, In Python</h2>
          <p>I'll start with Git, because Git (and version control in general) is a fundamental part of coding. It just becomes even fundamental-er when you work with other people. <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorial">Learn it.</a></p>
          <p>I refused to pair-program when I took 35 and 31 - in my day, the department was small enough that students could request to work solo without professors laughing/crying at you. I programmed by plugging my ears and bashing through code on my own. And maybe you, being forced to work with a partner, are wondering why pair-programming is required in CS classes (it's only partially so your graders don't drown). </p>
          <p>Python: Labs, research, data processing. Widespread even outside of CS. Lets you talk to computers - knowing what for- and while-loops are and how to use them will help you no matter where you go.</p>

          <h2 id="sec2">2. +Ideas, -Attitude</h2>
          <p>This leads off of the inter-personal side of pair-programming. </p>

          <h2 id="sec3">3. What else do you know?</h2>
          <p>In the end, what I came to appreciate at Nest was just how many doors open for students with CS experience <tt>who can do more than just CS</tt>. Anyone with access to the Internet can learn to program. But liberal arts students who can leverage their knowledge in other fields (shameless plug for majoring in Physics) can really add value. </p>

          <h2 id="sec4">Last Thoughts</h2>
          <p>Swat was </p>
          <p>(found the internship through Swat. Swat prepared me for it too. Mention how I'm working there now.)</p>
        <li>
          <p id='footnote1'>[1] Nest drew lots of talent from Apple - for example, Tony and Matt (the cofounders of Nest) were former Apple engineers.</p>
